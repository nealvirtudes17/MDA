    "# Numeric DataFrame Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we cover [statistical methods][1] for DataFrames with mainly numeric columns. These methods are nearly identical to those available to a Series. Again, we distinguish between methods that aggregate and those that do not. A method that performs an aggregation returns a **single** number to summarize the values. Any method that does not return a single value is not an aggregation. We begin by reading in the San Francisco employee compensation dataset.\n",

What may be potentially confusing is the orientation of the result. We began with a DataFrame, and were returned a Series which is visually displayed in the notebook as a vertical sequence of values. The orientation of the columns changed. It might have been easier to understand the operation if the columns remained horizontal as in the following image.\n",

Each column has a data type and all values in that column are the same data type. It is the column that is acted on by default by most of the methods as demonstrated with the aggregations above. \n",

You can also refer to it with the string `'index'`. Let's take the mean of each column again, but use the string 'index' for the value of the `axis` parameter.

    "The `mean` method is also extremely slow, even though it only works on numeric columns. This is because pandas takes the `sum` of all the columns first and then divides by the length. The reason pandas doesn't just skip over string columns is that they are technically object columns and an object column can hold any data type. The only way for pandas to decide whether or not the `mean` will work on an object column is to actually sum up every value first and then attempt to divide by the length. If that fails, then it will skip it. The issue with this, is that it is extremely slow for string columns since strings can be summed. pandas only fails after the string column has been concatenated together when it attempts to divide by the length. If you want to take the `mean` on a DataFrame with string columns, make sure you set `numeric_only` to `True.`"
