    "# What is pandas?\n",
    "\n",
    "pandas is one of the most popular open source data exploration libraries currently available. It gives its users the power to explore, query, transform, aggregate, and visualize **tabular** data. Tabular refers to data that is two-dimensional, consisting of rows and columns. Commonly, we refer to this organized structure of data as a **table**. pandas is the tool that we will use to analyze data in nearly every chapter of this book.\n",
    "\n",
    "![1]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why pandas and not xyz?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this current age of data explosion, there are now dozens of other tools that have many of the same capabilities as the pandas library. However, there are many aspects of pandas that make it an attractive choice for data analysis and it continues to have one of the fastest growing user bases.\n",
    "\n",
    "* It's a Python library and integrates well with the other popular data science libraries such as numpy, scikit-learn, statsmodels, matplotlib, and seaborn.\n",
    "* It is nearly self-contained in that lots of functionality is built into one package. This contrasts with R, where many packages are needed to obtain the same functionality.\n",
    "* The community is excellent. Looking at Stack Overflow, for example, there are [many ten's of thousands of][2] pandas questions. If you need help, you are nearly guaranteed to find it quickly. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is it named after an East Asian bear?\n",
    "\n",
    "The pandas library was begun by Wes McKinney in 2008 while working at the hedge fund AQR. In the financial world, it is common to refer to tabular data as 'panel data' which smashed together becomes pandas. If you are really interested in the history, hear it from the creator [himself][3].\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python already has data structures to handle data, why do we need another one?\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though Python is a high-level language, its primary built-in data structure to contain a sequence of values, lists, are not built for scientific computing. Lists are a general purpose data structure that can store any object of any type and are not optimized for tabular data analysis. Python lacks a built-in data structure that contains homogeneous data types for fast numerical computation. This data structure, usually referred to as an 'array' in most languages, is provided by the numpy third-party library.\n",
    "\n",
    "### pandas is built directly on numpy\n",
    "\n",
    "[numpy][4] ('numerical Python') is the most popular third-party Python library for scientific computing and forms the foundation for dozens of others, including pandas. numpy's primary data structure is an n-dimensional array which is much more powerful than a Python list and with much better performance for numerical operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the data in pandas is stored in numpy arrays. That said, it isn't necessary to know much about numpy when learning pandas. You can think of pandas as a higher-level, easier to use interface for doing data analysis than numpy. It is a good idea to eventually learn numpy, but for most data analysis tasks, pandas will be the right tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "## pandas operates on tabular data\n",
    "\n",
    "There are numerous formats for data, such as XML, JSON, CSV, Parquet, raw bytes, and many others. pandas has the capability to read in many different formats of data and always converts it to tabular form. pandas is built just for analyzing this rectangular, deceptively normal concept of data. pandas is not a suitable library for handling data in more than two-dimensions. It's focus is strictly on data that is one or two dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The DataFrame and Series\n",
    "\n",
    "The DataFrame and Series are the two primary pandas objects that we use throughout this book.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **DataFrame** - A two-dimensional data structure that looks like any other rectangular table of data with rows and columns.\n",
    "* **Series** - A single dimension of data. It is analogous to a single column of data or a one-dimensional array.\n",
    "\n",
    "## pandas examples\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of this chapter contains examples of common data analysis tasks with pandas. There are one or two examples from each of the following major areas of the library:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Reading data\n",
    "* Filtering data\n",
    "* Aggregating methods\n",
    "* Non-Aggregating methods\n",
    "* Aggregating within groups\n",
    "* Cleaning data\n",
    "* Joining data\n",
    "* Time series analysis\n",
    "* Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to give you a broad overview of what pandas is capable of doing. You are not expected to understand the syntax, but rather, get a few ideas of what you can expect to accomplish when using pandas. Explanations will be brief, but hopefully provide just enough information so that you can understand the end result.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `head` method\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the last lines of code end with the `head` method. By default, this method returns the first five rows of the DataFrame or Series that calls it. The purpose of this method is to limit the output so that it easily fits on a screen or page in a book. If the `head` method is not used, then pandas displays the first and last 5 rows of data by default (or all the rows if the DataFrame has 60 or less). To reduce output even further (to save space on the screen), an integer (usually 3) will be passed to the `head` method. This integer controls the number of rows returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Which pandas version to use?\n",
    "\n",
    "The pandas library is under constant development and regularly releases new versions. Currently, pandas is on major version **1**, which was released in January, 2020. Before major version 1, pandas was on version **0**. Python libraries use the form **a.b.c** for version numbering where **a** represents the **major** version number. It is increased whenever there are major changes, with some being backward incompatible. **b** represents the **minor** version number and is incremented for smaller backward-compatible changes and enhancements. **c** represents the **micro** version number and is incremented mainly for bug fixes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, only the major and minor version are written when speaking about the version of pandas as the micro version isn't all that important. pandas has a history of releasing around two or three minor versions per year. In order to run all of the code in this book, you need to be running **pandas 1.0** or greater.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Import pandas and verify version number\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's import pandas and verify it's version by accessing the special attribute `__version__`. If you are running any version of pandas less than 1.0 (such as 0.25 or below), then you'll need to exit the Jupyter Notebook, return to the command line and run `conda update pandas`.\n",
