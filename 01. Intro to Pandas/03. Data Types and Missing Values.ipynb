    "# Data Types and Missing Values\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most important pieces of information you can have about your DataFrame is the data type of each column. pandas stores its data such that each column is exactly one data type. A large number of data types are available for pandas DataFrame columns. This chapter focuses only on the most common data types and provides a brief summary of each one. For extensive coverage of each and every data type, see part **05. Data Types**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common data types\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are the most common data types that appear frequently in DataFrames. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **boolean** - Only two possible values, `True` and `False`\n",
    "* **integer** - Whole numbers without decimals\n",
    "* **float** - Numbers with decimals\n",
    "* **object** - Almost always strings, but can technically contain any Python object \n",
    "* **datetime** - Specific date and time with nanosecond precision\n",
    "\n",
    "### The importance of knowing the data type\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing the data type of each column of your pandas DataFrame is very important. The main reason for this is that every value in each column will be of the same type. For instance, if you select a single value from a column that has an integer data type, then you are guaranteed that this value is also an integer. Knowing the data type of a column is one of the most fundamental pieces of knowledge of your DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The exception with the object data type\n",
    "\n",
    "The object data type is the most confusing and deserves a longer discussion. It is an exception to the message in the last section. Each value in an object column can be any Python object. Object columns can contain integers, floats, or even data structures such as lists or dictionaries. Anything can be contained in object columns. But, nearly all of the time, columns with the object data type only contain strings. When you see a column with the object data type, you should expect the values to be strings. If you do have strings in your column values, the data type will be object, but you are not guaranteed that all values will be strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "## String data type - major enhancement to pandas 1.0\n",
    "\n",
    "Before the release of pandas version 1.0, there was no dedicated string data type. This was a huge limitation and caused numerous problems. pandas still has the 'object' data type, which is capable of holding strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the addition of the string data type, we are guaranteed that every value will be a string in a column with string data type. This new data type is still labeled as \"experimental\" in the pandas documentation, so I do not suggest using it for serious work yet. There are many bugs that need to be fixed and behavior sorted out before it is ready to use. Until then, this book will continue to use the object data type for columns containing strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Missing value representation\n",
    "\n",
    "Datasets often have missing values and need to have some representation to identify them. Pandas uses the object `NaN` and `NaT` to represent them.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `NaN` - \"Not a Number\"\n",
    "* `NaT` - \"Not a Time\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Missing values for each data type\n",
    "\n",
    "The missing value representation depends on the data type of the column. For our common data types, we have the following missing value representation for each.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **boolean** - No missing value representation\n",
    "* **integer** - No missing value representation\n",
    "* **float** -  `NaN`\n",
    "* **object** - `NaN`\n",
    "* **datetime** - `NaT`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Missing values in boolean and integer columns\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing that a column is either a boolean or integer column guarantees that there are no missing values in that column, as pandas does not allow for it. If, for instance, you would like to place a missing value in a boolean or integer column, then pandas would convert the entire column to float. This is because a float column can accommodate missing values. When booleans are converted to floats, False becomes 0 and True becomes 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "## New Integers and booleans data types in pandas 1.0\n",
    "\n",
    "Two new data types, the **nullable integer** and **nullable boolean** are now available in pandas 1.0. These are completely different data types than the original integer and boolean data types and have slightly different behavior. The main difference is that they do have missing value representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pandas NA - A new missing value representation for pandas 1.0\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, pandas relied on the numpy library to supply it's primary missing value, NaN, which continues to exist. With the release of version 1.0, pandas created it's own missing value representation, NA. This is a new and experimental addition, so its behavior can change.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recommendation for Pandas 1.0 - Avoid the new data types\n",
    "\n",
    "I recommend not using the new string, nullable integer, and nullable boolean data types along with the pandas NA until there has been more development with them. They are still experimental and their behavior can change. I've personally found several bugs and strange behavior using them and would wait until they are more stable. There will be a chapter dedicated to these new data types in part **05. Data Types** with more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Finding the data type of each column\n",
    "\n",
    "The `dtypes` DataFrame attribute (NOT a method) returns the data type of each column and is one of the first commands you should execute after reading in your data. Let's begin by using the `read_csv` function to read in the bikes dataset. "
