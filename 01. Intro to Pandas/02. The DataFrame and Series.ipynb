    "# The DataFrame and Series\n",
    "\n",
    "The DataFrame and Series are the two primary objects when using pandas to analyze data. In this chapter, we will learn how to read in data into a DataFrame and understand its components. We will also learn how to select a single column of data as a Series and examine its components.\n",

    "## Reading external data with pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "The one thing you need for data analysis is **data**. If you do not have any data, then you won't be able to use pandas to analyze it. This book contains many data sets stored externally in the `data` directory one level above where this notebook resides. Most of these datasets are stored as comma-separated value (**CSV**) files. These CSVs are human-readable and separate each individual piece of data with a comma. The comma is referred to as the **delimiter**. Despite its name, CSVs can use other one-character delimiters besides commas such as tabs, semi-colons, or others. \n",

    "\n",
    "We begin our data analysis adventure with a dataset on public bike rides from the city of Chicago. The data is contained in the `bikes.csv` file. There are about 50,000 recorded rides from 2013 through 2017. Each row of the dataset represents a single ride from a single person using the city's public bike stations. There are 19 columns of data containing information on gender, start time, trip duration, bike station name, temperature, wind speed, and more. Let's print out the first three lines of the `bikes.csv` file using Python's built-in capabilities for reading files. This does not use pandas. Take note of the commas separating each value on each line."

On the other hand, the Windows operating system uses the backslash. Fortunately, we can always use a forward slash regardless of our operating system, as Python will automatically handle the file location string for us.\n",

To visually display the DataFrame, place the variable name as the last line in a code cell. By default, pandas outputs the first and last 5 rows and first and last 10 columns. If there are less than 60 total rows, it displays all rows. We cover how to change these display options in an upcoming chapter.\n",

This avoids long default output and is something I highly recommend when doing data analysis within a notebook. The `tail` method returns the last 5 rows by default. There will only be a few instances in the book where the `head` method is not used, as displaying up to 60 rows is far too many and will take up a lot of space on a screen or page."

    "## Components of a DataFrame\n",
    "\n",
    "The DataFrame is composed of three separate components - the **columns**, the **index**, and the **data**. These terms will be used throughout the book and understanding them is vital to your ability to use pandas. Take a look at the following graphic of our `bikes` DataFrame stylized to put emphasis on each component.\n",
    "\n",
    "![1]\n",
    "\n",
    "### The columns\n",
    "\n",
    "The columns provide a **label** for each column and are always displayed in **bold** font above the data. A column is a single vertical sequence of data. In the above DataFrame, the column name `tripduration` references all the values in that column (993, 623, 1040, etc...).\n",
    "\n",
    "The columns are also referred to as the **column names** or the **column labels** with individual values referred to as a **column name** or **column label**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most DataFrames, like the one above, use strings for column names, but it is possible that they can be other types such as integers. The column names are not required to be unique, though having duplicate columns would be bad practice, as it's vital to be able to uniquely identify each column.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The index\n",
    "\n",
    "The index provides a **label** for each row and is always displayed to the left of the data. A row is a single horizontal sequence of data. For instance, the index label **3** references all the values in its row (12907, Subscriber, Male, etc...)\n",
    "\n",
    "The index is also referred to as the **index names/labels** or the **row names/labels** with the individual values referred to as a(n) **index name/label** or **row name/label**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above DataFrame, the index is simply a sequence of integers beginning at 0. The values in the index are not limited to integers. Strings are a common type that are used in the index and make for more descriptive labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Surprisingly, values in the index are not required to be unique. In fact, all of the index values can be the same. A row label does not guarantee a one-to-one mapping to one specific row.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The data\n",
    "\n",
    "The actual data is to the right of the index and below the columns and is displayed with normal font. The data is also referred to as the **values**. The data represents all the values for all the columns. It is important to note that the index and the columns are NOT part of the data. They are separate objects that act as **labels** for either rows or columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Axes\n",
    "\n",
    "The index and columns are known collectively as the **axes**, each representing a single **axis** of the two-dimensional DataFrame. pandas uses the integer **0** to reference the index and **1** for the columns.\n",

    "![0]\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that a Series has no rows and no columns. In appearance, it resembles a one-column DataFrame, but it technically has no columns. It just has a sequence of values that are labeled by an index.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The index\n",
    "\n",
    "A Series index serves as labels for the values. A single **label** or **name** always references a single value. In the above image, the index label **3** corresponds to the value 667. The Series index is virtually identical to the DataFrame index, so the same rules apply to it. Index values can be duplicated and can be types other than integers, such as strings. \n",

    "### Output of Series vs DataFrame\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that there is no nice HTML styling for the Series. It's just plain text. Below the Series display, you will see a few other items printed to the screen - the **name**, **length**, and **dtype**. These other items are NOT part of the Series itself and are just extra pieces of information to help you understand the Series.\n",

For instance, the default number of columns displayed for a DataFrame is 20, meaning that if your DataFrame has more than 20 columns, then only the first and last 10 columns will be shown on the screen.
