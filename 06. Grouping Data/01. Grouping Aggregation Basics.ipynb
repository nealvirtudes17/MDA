    "# Grouping Aggregation Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous chapters, calling DataFrame methods such as `sum` performed the action to every single value in each column as a **whole**. In this chapter, we will perform actions to distinct **groups** within our data, and not to the whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Group into independent DataFrames, then aggregate\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a look at the image below. We will group our original data into independent DataFrames based on the unique values of one or more columns. Below, our groups are based on the value of the Dept column. Once the data is split into these independent DataFrames, an aggregation is performed on each. Below, the Salary column is aggregated by the sum function and the Experience column is aggregated by the mean function.\n",
    "\n",
    "![1]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples of questions we can answer\n",
    "\n",
    "Grouping data is an extremely common technique used in data analysis and can help us answer a variety of questions. Some examples follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "* What is the maximum salary for every department at a company?\n",
    "* What is the average temperature and precipitation for every month for different cities?\n",
    "* What are the top five best selling shirts at each store?\n",

    "## Grouping with the `groupby` method\n",
    "\n",
    "The `groupby` method handles most of the tasks in pandas involving grouping data. This one method is responsible for grouping the data into independent DataFrames and performing the aggregation. It usually does so in a single line of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Aggregation\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common type of action to perform on each group is an aggregation, though it's possible to manipulate the data in each group any way you want. This chapter only covers how to perform aggregations on each group.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grouping Column, Aggregating Column, Aggregating Function\n",
    "\n",
    "Every `groupby` aggregation has three separate components - the grouping column, the aggregating column, and the aggregating function.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Grouping column** - Every distinct value in this column forms its own group\n",
    "* **Aggregating column** - The column we are applying the function to such that it aggregates (returns a single value). This column is usually numeric.\n",
    "* **Aggregating function** - The function that is applied to the aggregating column.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Syntax for using the `groupby` method\n",
    "\n",
    "The `groupby` method is not as straightforward to use as most other methods, and will take more effort to learn. Making it even more difficult, is the different valid types of syntax that do the same the thing. Only one version of the syntax will be covered at first, with the others delegated to a separate chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Must use method chaining with `groupby`\n",
    "\n",
    "Nearly all of the calls to `groupby` must have another method chained to it in order to return a result. The `groupby` method is a **two-step process**. First, we inform pandas how we would like to group, and then we chain the `agg` method to inform pandas how to aggregate. The general syntax takes the following form.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df.groupby('grouping column').agg(new_column=('aggregating column', 'aggregating function'))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The grouping column, aggregating column, and aggregating function may be provided as strings. The new column name, `new_column`, is provided as a parameter name in the `agg` method and is set to the two-item tuple of the aggregating column and aggregating function."
