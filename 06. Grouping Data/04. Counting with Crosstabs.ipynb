This isn't easily doable with `groupby` or `pivot_table`. The `crosstab` function allows you to normalize over the rows, columns, or all of the data. For instance, to find the relative frequency of people who have sought treatment in each country, you can normalize across each row like this. The rows should all sum to 100%."

    "As we saw above, `crosstab` has the ability to normalize over rows, columns, and the entire table. It's possible to normalize over any aggregation provided, not just frequency (the default). Here, we find the percentage of the total female (and male) salaries by department by setting `normalize` to `'columns'`. It informs us, that out of the total of female salaries, 3.8% are from the fire department, 24.8% are from the police department, etc... It provides a distribution of each column over the index. The columns total to 100%."
