    "# Filtering with the `query` Method\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous chapters on boolean selection showed us how to filter our DataFrames and Series based on their values. We created conditions, usually involving the comparison operators, resulting in boolean Series and passed them to the *just the brackets* or `loc` indexers to filter the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter we cover the `query` method, which enables us to also make selections based on the values of the DataFrame or Series. The `query` method is easier and more intuitive to use than boolean selection, but doesn't provide as much functionality to filter the data. Still, it is a good method to know about to make your subset selections more readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The `query` method\n",
    "\n",
    "The `query` method allows you to filter the data by writing the condition as a string. For instance, you would use the string `'tripduration > 1000'` to select all rows of the `bikes` dataset that have a `tripduration` greater than 1,000. Let's read in the bikes dataset and run this command now."
