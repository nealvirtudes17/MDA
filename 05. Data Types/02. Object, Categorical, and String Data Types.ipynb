    "# Object, Categorical, and String Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, our focus turns to the data types that primarily contain strings. Currently, pandas uses the three data types object, string, and categorical. The string data type is new to pandas and still undergoing changes. The categorical data type has yet to be discussed, but is a fantastic way to save memory and significantly increase performance for operations done on columns containing strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Object data types\n",
    "\n",
    "Until the release of pandas 1.0, pandas did not have a string-only data type. Instead, it used the 'object' data type to hold strings. As mentioned previously, the object data type has no limitation as to what Python object can be within it. It is essentially a catch-all for any item that you desire to be in a DataFrame that doesn't belong to the other specific data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Series with the object data type do not have analogous size representation like integer and float data types do. There is no `'object64'`, only a single 'object' data type. Each item can be of a different type and therefore of a different size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though the object data type may contain any Python object, it is primarily used to hold strings. Let's begin by constructing a Series with a couple of strings as values."
